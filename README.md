# Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This is my work in the IBM Data Science course on Coursera.

This project is about predict the injury level on a car accident.

The notebook includes all the stage for a data science project such as Data Understaning, Data cleaning, Feature engineering and Modeling.

In modeling stage, I mainly used the Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbour to predict

As a result, the Decision Tree is the best model for predicting the car accident injury level.
